# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code & Codex when working with code in this repository.

## What This Is

Takode — a web orchestration UI for Claude Code & Codex.
It began as a Companion fork and now provides a multi-session workspace with cross-session coordination, Questmaster workflows, tool-call visibility, and permission control.

## Project Progress

Use Questmaster to track project progress for this repository. Treat project tasks/todos as quests and keep status current via the `quest` CLI and Questmaster workflow.

Questmaster tags should follow the generated quest skill's small generic two-axis taxonomy: refined-and-later quests generally use one area tag plus one work-type tag, while specific project/component nouns belong in title/TLDR/description/search instead of tags. Keep public tag-guidance examples mocked rather than using real project, repo, component, feature, or product names.

## Durable User Data Safety

Before any action that could delete, reset, overwrite, migrate, or bulk-mutate durable user data, verify the target, isolation, and recovery path. Durable user data includes Questmaster records, sessions, memory, settings, worktrees, images/artifacts, and other user-owned state.

Treat destructive tests and helpers as dangerous until their data paths are proven isolated to temporary or disposable state. Before destructive operations against durable user data, have a backup, snapshot, or explicit recovery plan; if isolation or recovery status is uncertain, stop and route for approval. Standard approved workflows may proceed when their documented steps provide verified isolation or recovery.

## Skills (Auto-Installed)

The Takode server symlinks project skills into global skill directories at startup (see `web/server/skill-symlink.ts` and `web/server/index.ts`). Claude-facing skills are installed into `~/.claude/skills/`; Codex/new-agent skills are installed into `~/.agents/skills/`. The canonical Claude-facing project source remains `.claude/skills/` in the repo, while `.agents/skills/` is the single non-Claude project skill source. Legacy `.codex/skills/` content is compatibility-only and may be migrated into `.agents`; do not add new project skills there.

Global skills are auto-discovered by every session and can be hard to remove once installed. Avoid adding global skills for context-dependent instructions. Prefer repo instruction files in known locations, then inject or reference those exact file paths only for the agents that need that context.

For Takode-wide cluster usage, runbook, or agent/skill documentation work, first look for any local/private cluster docs outside this tracked repository. Treat those docs as optional local context that may not exist on every machine, and keep tracked repo guidance generic. Do not copy sensitive cluster details into tracked files.

### Design Decisions as Skills

For Takode repo work only, leaders should proactively propose focused repo-level design-principle skills when a user describes reusable guidance or when repeated failures suggest codified guidance would prevent recurrence. These skills should explain the principle, motivation, and practical application. Their frontmatter descriptions must clearly state when future agents should read them, using concrete trigger terms rather than vague names.

If an implementation plan or user proposal conflicts with an existing design-principle skill, surface the conflict before changing code and decide whether to update the principle or revise the proposal. Preserve the existing skill-source boundaries above: use `.claude/skills` for Claude-facing Takode project skills, `.agents/skills` only when a distinct non-Claude source is needed, and do not add new project skills under legacy `.codex/skills`. This is a Takode-repo instruction, not a universal rule for other repositories.

Additionally, `quest-integration.ts` generates and installs the `quest` skill docs (from `web/server/templates/quest-skill-docs.md`) into the Claude and `.agents` skill directories at startup.
Quest Journey phases are guided by the canonical phase briefs in `~/.companion/quest-journey-phases/<phase-id>/`, not by globally installed phase skills. Historical and canonical phase skill slugs remain internal Quest Journey compatibility metadata only; they are not installed as worker-visible skills.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install web dependencies once before the first local dev run,
# and rerun after pulling dependency changes
bun install --cwd web --frozen-lockfile

# Dev server (Hono backend on :3456 + Vite HMR on :5174)
make dev

# Shared resource coordination
# Before starting or using shared dev servers, Agent Browser, or E2E/browser workflows,
# inspect current lease state, then acquire the relevant Takode lease before use:
takode lease status dev-server:companion
takode lease acquire dev-server:companion --purpose "Run local UI verification" --ttl 30m
takode lease renew dev-server:companion
takode lease release dev-server:companion

# Direct web runner
cd web && bun --no-install run dev

# Type checking
cd web && bun --no-install run typecheck

# Production build + serve
cd web && bun --no-install run build && bun --no-install run start

# Offline injected system prompt inspection, no live server required
cd web && bun --no-install -e 'import { buildInjectedSystemPromptForDebug } from "./server/cli-launcher-instructions.ts"; console.log(buildInjectedSystemPromptForDebug({ sessionNum: 1, backend: "claude", isOrchestrator: true }))'
```

## Dependency and Install Policy

- Active package manifests pin the package manager with `packageManager: "bun@1.3.10"` and exact-pin direct dependencies/devDependencies.
- Routine setup uses frozen installs: `bun install --cwd web --frozen-lockfile`. Use `bun install --frozen-lockfile` at the repo root only when root developer hooks are needed.
- Dependency changes must review manifest and lockfile diffs together. Avoid plain `bun install` for routine work because it may refresh lockfiles or float direct ranges.
- Before trusting lifecycle scripts introduced by dependency changes, run `bun pm untrusted` and review the package. Use focused trust decisions.
- For dependency additions/updates, default to a 3-day minimum release age: `--minimum-release-age=259200`. Override only for urgent security fixes or extension/tooling compatibility, and document why.
- Helper scripts should fail fast when dependencies are missing. Any convenience install path must be explicitly opted in with `TAKODE_AUTO_INSTALL=1` and must use `--frozen-lockfile`.
- `@vscode/vsce` is trusted VS Code extension packaging tooling scoped to `vscode/takode-panel-prototype/`; keep it exact-pinned there, invoked through the local binary, and out of `web`/server runtime dependencies.

See [Dependency and Install Policy](docs/dependency-policy.md) for the contributor-facing version.

## Codex Shell PATH Note

- In Codex tool calls, prefer a non-login shell (`login: false`) for command execution. In this environment, login shells can drop `~/.bun/bin` and `~/.nvm/.../bin` from `PATH`.
- Before running tests/builds, verify runtime availability with `command -v bun && bun --version` (and optionally `command -v node && node -v`).
- If PATH is still wrong, use absolute binaries as a fallback:
  - `/home/jiayiwei/.bun/bin/bun`
  - `/home/jiayiwei/.nvm/versions/node/v22.21.1/bin/node`

## Testing

```bash
# Run tests
cd web && bun --no-install run test

# Watch mode
cd web && bun --no-install run test:watch

# Current lint/format-equivalent gate
cd web && bun --no-install run format:check
```

- All new backend (`web/server/`) and frontend (`web/src/`) code **must** include tests when possible.
- Tests use Vitest. Server tests live alongside source files (e.g. `routes.test.ts` next to `routes.ts`).
- Keep path-dependent tests portable: derive host-dependent expectations from the runtime environment or a controlled fixture root instead of hardcoding a developer's home or checkout path. Fixed synthetic paths are valid test data. Keep test writes and cleanup under isolated temporary roots, never real home or durable user-data directories.
- A husky pre-commit hook runs staged formatting, the staged file line-limit guard, and typecheck automatically before each commit. It does not run the full test suite.
- For tracked code/test changes, the current full automated gate before merge, Port push, or final acceptance is:
  - `cd web && bun --no-install run typecheck`
  - `cd web && bun --no-install run test`
  - `cd web && bun --no-install run format:check`
- `format:check` is the current lint/format-equivalent gate in this repo; there is no separate `lint` script right now.
- If a full run is infeasible, document the exception explicitly in your quest summary, review handoff, or other acceptance notes before asking for merge or final acceptance.
- **Never remove or delete existing tests.** If a test is failing, fix the code or the test. If you believe a test should be removed, you must first explain to the user why and get explicit approval before removing it.
- When creating test, make sure to document what the test is validating, and any important context or edge cases in comments within the test code.
- For chat feed, thread-window, notification, or selected-thread rendering changes, apply the [Feed and Thread Debugging Guardrails](docs/feed-thread-debugging.md). In particular, manual render/model loops must have an explicit progress invariant, and tests should use producer-shaped thread/window payloads instead of frontend-invented shapes.

## File Size Guardrail

- Files must stay at or under 2000 lines.
- If a change would push a file over 2000 lines, split the file before committing instead of extending it further.
- Do not try to satisfy the file-size limit with superficial line-count tricks such as collapsing formatting, removing useful whitespace/comments, or otherwise making the file harder to read. When a file is over the limit, reduce it with a real refactor or extraction that improves structure.
- The pre-commit limit is enforced against staged file contents only, so exactly 2000 lines is allowed and anything over 2000 lines fails the commit.

## Verification

- After implementing changes, verify them end-to-end when possible. For CLI tools, run the command in your worktree. For scripts, execute them. For logic changes, write a test that exercises the actual code path.
- When end-to-end verification requires a shared resource (running dev server, UI), document what should be manually verified post-deploy in the quest's verification items.

## Component Playground

All UI components used in the message/chat flow **must** be represented in the Playground page (`web/src/components/Playground.tsx`, accessible at `#/playground`). When adding or modifying a message-related component (e.g. `MessageBubble`, `ToolBlock`, `PermissionBanner`, `Composer`, streaming indicators, tool groups, subagent groups), update the Playground to include a mock of the new or changed state.

## Architecture

### Data Flow

```
Browser (React) ←→ WebSocket ←→ Hono Server (Bun) ←→ WebSocket (NDJSON) ←→ Claude Code CLI
     :5174              /ws/browser/:id        :3456        /ws/cli/:id         (--sdk-url)
```

1. Browser sends a "create session" REST call to the server
2. Server spawns `claude --sdk-url ws://localhost:3456/ws/cli/SESSION_ID` as a subprocess
3. CLI connects back to the server over WebSocket using NDJSON protocol
4. Server bridges messages between CLI WebSocket and browser WebSocket
5. Tool calls arrive as `control_request` (subtype `can_use_tool`) — browser renders approval UI, server relays `control_response` back

### All code lives under `web/`

- **`web/server/`** — Hono + Bun backend (runs on port 3456)

  **Core runtime:**
  - `index.ts` — Server bootstrap, Bun.serve with dual WebSocket upgrade (CLI vs browser)
  - `ws-bridge.ts` — Session-level state machine and WebSocket message router. Orchestrates bridge subsystems, broadcasts canonical session updates.
  - `bridge/` — Extracted bridge controllers (see details below). Each handles a focused concern (permissions, lifecycle, transport, recovery) and operates on narrow interfaces rather than full bridge state.
  - `service.ts` — Shared service container wiring server-wide dependencies.

  **CLI launchers** (split by backend and concern):
  - `cli-launcher.ts` — Core process lifecycle: spawn, kill, relaunch Claude Code CLI. Handles `--resume` for session recovery.

- **`web/bin/cli.ts`** — Main CLI entry point (currently invoked as `bunx the-companion`). Sets `__COMPANION_PACKAGE_ROOT` and imports the server.

### WebSocket Protocol

Claude Code uses NDJSON (newline-delimited JSON), while Codex uses JSON-RPC through `codex-adapter.ts`; both are normalized by the bridge. Common message categories include `system` (init/status), `assistant`, `result`, `stream_event`, `control_request`/`control_response`, tool progress/summary updates, and `keep_alive`.

Full protocol documentation is in `WEBSOCKET_PROTOCOL_REVERSED.md`.

### Session Lifecycle

Sessions persist to disk (`~/.companion/sessions/`) and survive server restarts. On restart, live CLI processes are detected by PID and given a grace period to reconnect their WebSocket. If they don't, they're killed and relaunched with `--resume` using the CLI's internal session ID.

### Raw Protocol Recordings

Raw protocol recording is an explicit debugging opt-in. Normal startup does not record Claude Code NDJSON, Codex JSON-RPC, or browser transport payloads. To temporarily capture every session, start or restart Takode with exactly `COMPANION_RECORD=1` or `COMPANION_RECORD=true`; unset, `0`, `false`, and all other values keep automatic capture off. Automatic capture can consume substantial memory and disk when many sessions receive large global payloads, so enable it only while collecting a bounded diagnostic.

- **Location**: `$TMPDIR/companion-recordings/` by default (fast local tmpfs). Override with `COMPANION_RECORDINGS_DIR` for persistent storage (e.g. `~/.companion/recordings/`).
- **Format**: JSONL — one JSON object per line. First line is a header with session metadata, subsequent lines are raw message entries.
- **File naming**: `{sessionId}_{backendType}_{ISO-timestamp}_{randomSuffix}.jsonl`
- **Automatic opt-in**: set exactly `COMPANION_RECORD=1` or `COMPANION_RECORD=true` before server startup
- **Manual capture**: use the per-session REST start/stop endpoints below; manual capture is process-local, affects only that session, and does not survive restart
- **Existing files**: listing and status remain available while automatic capture is off; disabling capture does not delete or migrate files
- **Rotation**: when automatic capture is enabled, cleanup runs when total lines exceed 500k (configurable via `COMPANION_RECORDINGS_MAX_LINES`)

Each entry captures:
```json
{"ts": 1771153996875, "dir": "in", "raw": "{\"type\":\"system\",...}", "ch": "cli"}
```
- `dir`: `"in"` (received by server) or `"out"` (sent by server)
- `ch`: `"cli"` (Claude Code / Codex process) or `"browser"` (frontend WebSocket)
- `raw`: the exact original string — never re-serialized, preserving the true protocol payload

**REST API**:
- `GET /api/recordings` — list all recording files with metadata
- `GET /api/sessions/:id/recording/status` — check if a session is recording + file path
- `POST /api/sessions/:id/recording/start` / `stop` — enable/disable per session

To return to the safe default after temporary automatic capture, remove `COMPANION_RECORD` (or set it to `0`/`false`) and restart Takode. Recordings are debugging artifacts and production session behavior must not depend on them.

**Code**: `web/server/recorder.ts` (recorder + manager), `web/server/replay.ts` (load & filter utilities).

## Fork Policy: Takode + Worktrees

Takode was originally forked from [The-Vibe-Company/companion](https://github.com/The-Vibe-Company/companion), but it has since heavily diverged in architecture and features.

Git worktrees are the preferred isolation model for this project. Container support remains available for compatibility, but new workflow guidance should continue to prioritize worktree-based development.

For Takode repository push, publish, and remote-branch operations, use the user's personal GitHub account rather than the default work GitHub account. Keep this scoped to Takode: other repositories should continue using the default work GitHub account unless their own repo instructions say otherwise. Do not record or expose credential contents, private key paths, tokens, or repo-local Git config values when applying this policy.

## Key Architectural Principles
(please keep these updated as you work on the codebase)

- **Production serves an isolated frontend snapshot.** `make serve` builds Vite output into a fresh validated app-owned directory under `~/.companion/runtime/frontends`, while direct CLI, package-script, and service starts validate and copy their packaged or explicitly configured frontend source there before importing the backend. Each server receives `COMPANION_FRONTEND_ROOT` for its immutable snapshot, so worker/development builds or cleanup cannot make the live UI disappear. On a supervised restart build failure, keep serving the previous validated snapshot.
- **Backend liveness and application readiness are separate.** `/api/health` reports that the backend process/API is reachable. `/api/ready` reports whether the current production frontend root contains a usable index, local entry assets, and manifest; development mode is ready through Vite. Browser restart polling, embedded UI probes, and startup scripts that promise a usable app must use readiness rather than liveness.
- **Takode supports one compatible frontend/backend build.** Supported operation assumes the frontend bundle and backend process carry the same build identity; do not retain dual protocols or state models solely for mixed-version operation. Detect identity mismatches and offer an explicit frontend Reload instead of silently falling back or reloading while the user may be working. Restart Server must build and validate the replacement frontend before shutting down the current compatible pair, so a failed build leaves that pair available. Keep explicit one-time persisted-state migrations when durable user data still requires them.
- **Server is the single source of truth for all session state.** The browser must never optimistically mutate session state (messages, permission mode, model, metrics, session name, etc.) locally. Instead, the browser sends requests to the server, and the server broadcasts authoritative state updates back to ALL connected browsers. This ensures multi-browser consistency: desktop, mobile, or any number of tabs always show the same state. The only exception is purely local UI state (scroll position, sidebar open/closed, composer draft, dark mode, etc.) which is never shared across browsers.
- **Server history is authoritative.** Current-build browsers receive server-authored bounded state through `history_window_sync` and `thread_window_sync`; explicit `history_sync` remains the one-shot full-history/hash-recovery path. Each authoritative window or recovery snapshot replaces the state it owns rather than merging an assumed-complete browser corpus. The server's `session.messageHistory` is the single source of truth.
- **Resume replay must be idempotent for history-backed messages.** CLI `--resume` and reconnect replay can resend historical `assistant`, `result`, `compact_marker`, and `tool_result_preview` payloads. Any server path that appends to `session.messageHistory` for replayable messages must deduplicate against existing history first; otherwise replay artifacts become permanently persisted hot-tail growth and later inflate `history_sync`/session-store costs.
- **`messageHistory` is browser-only.** The server's `session.messageHistory` array is used to compose bounded browser history/thread windows, live replay support, and explicit full-history recovery. It is never sent to the CLI. Compaction only affects the CLI's internal context — changes to `messageHistory` (like appending compact markers) don't interfere with Claude Code's session.
- **CLI protocol types can diverge from TypeScript definitions.** The CLI sometimes sends fields in unexpected formats (e.g. compaction summary as a plain `string` instead of `ContentBlock[]`). Always handle both forms defensively and update the types in `session-types.ts` to match observed behavior. Protocol recordings in `~/.companion/recordings/` are the ground truth.
- **Backend tool failures must not become session failures.** Treat model-backend tool-call or router failures from Codex or Claude Code, such as Codex `write_stdin failed`, as scoped tool-call/data-plane failures. Surface failed tool output or a scoped diagnostic, preserve raw logs for debugging, clear turn/generation state coherently, and keep pending delivery plus later user/leader input deliverable. Do not convert recognized tool failures into top-level session failures unless the backend itself is unrecoverable; if a failure may leave stale turn state or pending delivery, use it as an explicit recovery signal.
- **Use `process.execPath` in tests**, not `"bun"`. Bun may not be on the default PATH (e.g. installed in `~/.bun/bin`). `process.execPath` resolves to whatever runtime is executing the tests.
- **Browser localStorage is scoped per server instance.** Each server has a stable UUID (`serverId`) in `~/.companion/settings.json`, exposed via `GET /api/settings`. The frontend caches this in `localStorage["cc-server-id"]` and uses `web/src/utils/scoped-storage.ts` to prefix all server-specific keys (sessions, selected backend, recent dirs, etc.) with `{serverId}:`. Global user preferences (dark mode, zoom, notifications, telemetry) are never prefixed. When adding new localStorage keys, use `scopedGetItem`/`scopedSetItem`/`scopedRemoveItem` for server-specific state, or raw `localStorage` for global preferences. Add new global keys to the `GLOBAL_KEYS` set in `scoped-storage.ts`.
- **Minimize localStorage for session-derived state.** localStorage should only store purely local UI preferences (dark mode, zoom, sidebar state, composer drafts) and session creation defaults (selected backend, recent dirs). Any state derived from session activity (attention/unread badges, pending permissions, session names) must be reset from the server on every reconnect — never trust localStorage as the source of truth for these. Treat `history_window_sync` and explicit `history_sync` as authoritative session-feed deliveries and clear the browser-derived state they replace before processing; `thread_window_sync` replaces only its selected thread cache. This prevents stale data from surviving server restarts or multi-browser usage.
- **Never use synchronous file I/O in server code.** The server may run on NFS where a single `writeFileSync` can block 100ms+, stalling all WebSocket messages and HTTP responses (causing "Server unreachable" banners). Rules:
  - **All file reads/writes** must use `node:fs/promises` (`readFile`, `writeFile`, `readdir`, `unlink`, `stat`, `access`) — never `readFileSync`, `writeFileSync`, etc.
  - **All shell commands** in request handlers must use `execAsync`/`execPromise` — never `execSync`. The only exception is server startup (before the event loop serves requests).
  - **Fire-and-forget writes** (session saves, launcher state): call the async function without `await`, add `.catch()` for error logging. Keep the caller's signature `void` for API compatibility.
  - **Chained async writes** for stateful stores: use the `_pendingWrite.then(...)` pattern so writes execute in order and `_flushForTest()` can await all writes. See `settings-manager.ts` and `session-names.ts` as canonical examples.
  - **Buffered async writes** for high-throughput logging: buffer lines in memory, flush every 200ms via async `appendFile`. See `server-logger.ts` and `recorder.ts` as canonical examples.
  - **`mkdirSync` in constructors** is the only acceptable sync fs call — it's a cold path (once at startup) and prevents race conditions with concurrent async mkdirs.
  - **`// sync-ok` escape hatch**: Sync calls on documented cold paths (startup, session creation, CLI-only code) must have a `// sync-ok: <reason>` comment on the same line. The `architecture-guards.test.ts` Vitest test scans all `web/server/` source files and fails on any unannotated sync I/O call.
  - **Git commands** must include `--no-optional-locks` to avoid NFS lock contention on `.git/index.lock`.
  - **Recordings** default to `$TMPDIR/companion-recordings/` (local tmpfs, ~37× faster than NFS). They are ephemeral debugging data — never read by production code.
  - **Session data** stays on the home directory for persistence across reboots — it is critical user data. Optimize with async writes and debouncing, not by moving to tmpfs.
- **CLI connection liveness is maintained through three layers:**
  1. **Heartbeat pings (10s):** The server pings all CLI WebSockets every 10s via `ws.ping()`. Bun doesn't expose pong callbacks, so this is polling-based — if `ping()` throws, the socket is dead. The protocol also includes application-level `keep_alive` messages, but heartbeat ping/pong + send-failure detection remain the primary liveness signals.
  2. **Send failure detection:** When the server tries to send a message to a dead CLI socket, `ws.send()` throws. The catch handler closes the socket, which triggers `handleCLIClose` and the auto-relaunch mechanism. This gives instant detection on the next outbound message.
  3. **Auto-relaunch on disconnect:** When a CLI disconnects (via `handleCLIClose`), the server proactively requests a relaunch after a 2-second delay — no need to wait for a browser to connect and discover the dead session. The delay avoids relaunching during transient network blips. Safety: `relaunchingSet` (5s throttle) prevents concurrent relaunches, `killedByIdleManager` check skips intentional kills, and cli-launcher's fast-exit retry handles crash loops.
  - **Worktree setup must be fully async.** Creating a new worktree session involves file I/O (guardrails injection, git exclude, settings symlinks) and git commands (`update-index --skip-worktree`). On NFS, synchronous versions of these operations can block the event loop for 10+ seconds, killing all CLI WebSocket connections. All worktree setup methods in `cli-launcher.ts` (`injectWorktreeGuardrails`, `addWorktreeGitExclude`, `symlinkProjectSettings`) must use async I/O.

## Browser Exploration

For Takode UI/E2E validation workflows, use the `takode-ui-e2e-validation` skill.

Before browser/E2E work, you must acquire the appropriate resource lease. Full browser validation usually needs both `dev-server:companion` and `agent-browser`; server-only work needs `dev-server:companion`; browser-only inspection of an already-authorized server needs `agent-browser`. Use `takode lease status <resource>` only to inspect current ownership before acquiring; it is not a substitute for holding the lease. If a lease command queues you, wait for the Resource Lease promotion message instead of polling. Heartbeat while using the resource and release it promptly when done.

For normal Takode E2E/browser validation, default to the authorized shared persistent validation state for the dev-server workflow when one is available. Treat that state as shared validation evidence: workers may add useful long conversations, sessions, quests, and scenarios, and should retain newly created state when it is likely to help future validation. Clean up only state that is clearly harmful, misleading, sensitive, destructive, or otherwise not useful. Use isolated temp HOME/state, Playground/browser fixtures, or sanitized copied-live snapshots only when isolation is required, such as destructive tests, privacy-sensitive data, reset-sensitive scenarios, narrow frontend-only checks, or a bug tied to a specific copied history. Always document the profile/state strategy, scenario provenance, and cleanup/retention decision in Execute or validation notes.

Always use the `agent-browser` CLI command to explore the browser.
When running E2E tests, use the dark theme, as it is the primary theme of this app.
When running E2E tests, use a viewport at least as large as a normal iPhone Pro/Max screen (for example `430x932`).

## Pull Requests

When submitting a pull request:
- use commitzen to format the commit message and the PR title
- Add a screenshot of the changes in the PR description if its a visual change
- Explain simply what the PR does and why it's needed
- Tell me if the code was reviewed by a human or simply generated directly by an AI. 

### How To Open A PR With GitHub CLI

Use this flow from the repository root:

```bash
# 1) Create a branch
git checkout -b fix/short-description (commitzen)

# 2) Commit using commitzen format
git add <files>
git commit -m "fix(scope): short summary" (commitzen)

# 3) Push and set upstream using the Takode personal-account remote policy
git push -u <personal-remote> fix/short-description

# 4) Create PR (title should follow commitzen style)
gh pr create --base main --head fix/short-description --title "fix(scope): short summary"
```

For multi-line PR descriptions, prefer a body file to avoid shell quoting issues:

```bash
cat > /tmp/pr_body.md <<'EOF'
## Summary
- what changed

## Why
- why this is needed

## Testing
- what was run

## Review provenance
- Implemented by AI agent / Human
- Human review: yes/no
EOF

gh pr edit --body-file /tmp/pr_body.md
```

## Codex & Claude Code
- All features must be compatible with both Codex and Claude Code. If a feature is only compatible with one, it must be gated behind a clear UI affordance (e.g. "This feature requires Claude Code") and the incompatible option should be hidden or disabled.
- When implementing a new feature, always consider how it will work with both models and test with both if possible. If a feature is only implemented for one model, document that clearly in the code and in the UI.
